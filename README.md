# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
In this project, I wrote Python code to import data related to bike share systems 
for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
Then, I answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in 
the terminal to present these statistics.

# Software Requirements
* Python 3
* Numpy and Pandas installed using Anaconda
* A terminal application

# Project detailed description (from Udacity)
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and 
popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to 
rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to 
borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return 
it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each 
bike can serve several users per day.
