# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
In this project, I wrote Python code to import data related to bike share systems 
for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
Then, I answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in 
the terminal to present these statistics.

# Software Requirements
* Python 3
* Numpy and Pandas installed using Anaconda
* A terminal application
